# Ashleigh Maund


I am a creative and acquisitive maths graduate, inspired by the world of coding and with a particular passion for problem-solving. I am now fresh out of Makers Academy, a 12 week intensive coding course, where I became familiar with Ruby and Javascript and many coding principles and I'm hoping to commit the skills I have developed over the last few months to a well-knit team of enthusiastic developers, facing new challenges as I engage with a whole range of tech along the way.




## Skills




#### Problem-solving

It is thanks to my maths degree, and my more creative interests, that I have been able to apply logical thinking in an inventive way to find solutions to challenges that I have had to solve, which has proved useful over the 3 months I have been at Makers and hopefully thereafter.

I undertook many modules that exercised my skills in problem-solving, such as Complex Analysis (the analysis of 'complex' numbers and how they can be used to solve real world problems), Number Theory (the study of how rational numbers interact, and using this knowledge to solve complex systems geometrically), Mathematical Biology (using sets of equations known as reaction-diffusion systems to map biological patterns in growth).





#### Design

I find the design aspect of an application to be my favourite part, whether it be designing a solution to a complex back end logical dilemma or designing the visual layout on the front end, to the point where I have piles of notebooks full of diagrams on different routes to solving one thing

Many moons ago during my school years, I used to write and maintain my own blog on Blogger. I found the templates provided by Blogger at the time not too inspiring so I decided to learn CSS3 to help me keep the style of my blog more up to date, alongside excessive use of Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator) to create backgrounds and buttons to customise it even more.

Examples of my work with CSS:
- [hipsterTill](https://github.com/ashleigh090990/hipster-till)
- [toDo](https://github.com/ashleigh090990/to-do)
- [GitHub User Search](https://github.com/ashleigh090990/github-profiles)






#### Teamwork

As a friendly and composed person, I find working with other people enjoyable and incredibly valuable, as the exposure to other people's knowledge guarantees that you are always learning something new and rejuvinates your own perspective on how to solve perplexing problems. Working in a team has also improved my git version control, most specifically when working on:

- The art of pair programming every day at Makers, which taught me how important communication is in order to engage fully with your pair and the code that you are writing together, and the great joys of 'git pong'.

- Group projects, one of which was [Movie Snaps](https://github.com/ashleigh090990/movie-snaps-project), a web application where users can upload photos of themselves at famous locations where movies have been filmed, which took two weeks and six people to build using Ruby on Rails. A version of this was also deployed to [Heroku](https://movie-snaps.herokuapp.com/). I became proficient at resolving merge conflicts, as with so many people working on this project, merging code which has not been checked thoroughly can cause a lot of problems that are harder to fix down the line.







## Education

#### Makers Academy (27/04/2015 to /07/2015)

- I am able to write programs in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js, Angular.js
- I became confident using testing frameworks such as Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma, Protractor







#### University of Reading (01/09/2009 to 04/07/2012)

- Mathematics BSc (Hons)
- Was a keen and active member of the Netball, Drama, Rock and Art Societies



#### St Bernard's Catholic Grammar School (01/09/2007 to 30/06/2009)

- A Levels in Art, Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics
- Regularly played for the school Netball team
